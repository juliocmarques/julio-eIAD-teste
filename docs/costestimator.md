# e-IAD Accelerator - Estimation

In general, use the Azure pricing calculator to estimate costs. The ideal individual pricing tier and the total overall cost of each service included in the architecture is dependent on the amount of data to be processed and stored and the acceptable performance level expected.

The Azure pricing calculator allows you to mix and match different combinations of Azure services deployed for e-IAD Accelerator to see an estimate of the costs.
